- **Functions**: `=SUM(A1:A10)`
- **Conditional Expressions**: `=IF(A1 > 10, "High", "Low")`
- **Range**: `=A1:A10`, get values from A1 to A10

The Calc Language supports a variety of functions and operations, making it a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis within the terminal.

- **Normal Mode**: Default mode for navigation.
- **Insert Mode**: Mode for editing cell values.
- **Visual Mode**: Mode for selecting multiple cells.
- **Command Mode**: Mode for executing commands.
- **Exit Mode**: Mode to exit the application.

### Key Bindings
